Project 1: Data transforming and calculating summary statistics and a few visualizations

Project 2: A hypothesis test and cleaning some data before training a regression model.

Project 3: Performing model evaluation, model selection and feature selection in both a regression and classification setting

Project 4: There two parts here

In Part 1, I use PCA to plot a high dimensional dataset in 2D. I then perform K-Means clustering on the dataset and plot using the same PCA representation to see how clustered our data is in the original 64D space.

In Part 2, I generate recommendations on products from a department store based on product descriptions.
I first transform the data into topics using Latent Dirichlet Approximation, and then generate recommendations based on this new representation.
